# The Unpredictable Countdown Timer

The Unpredictable Countdown Timer is a web-based app that reimagines a traditional timer by introducing unexpected behavior. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project turns a simple countdown into a fun and engaging challenge. Rather than counting down smoothly, the timer may randomly speed up, slow down, pause, or freeze—creating a unique experience every time.

## Features

- Randomized timer behavior:
  - Speed changes
  - Pauses
  - Freezes mid-countdown
- User-controlled start and reset functionality
- Clean, responsive interface
- Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Purpose

This project was created as a light, interactive experiment to challenge users’ expectations and introduce unpredictability into a common digital tool. It’s not built for precision—but for fun and unpredictability.
